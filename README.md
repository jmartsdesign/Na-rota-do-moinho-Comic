Comic created from photos taken on a bike ride. Work done with Wick Editor and other software.

It is a simple story based on selected photos from the bike tour. The photographs were converted to look like they were drawn and painted with FotoSketcher software. The pagination was done on the Book Creator platform and cut and edited with the Gimp.

The main objective was to work with the Wick Editor as an alternative to Flash, creating an interactive book and not a simple PDF.

I hope you like it and support the work.

Sorry to be in Portuguese if you want in English put it in the comments, thank you.
